Hey there, I'm Luci!

I'm your friendly neighborhood game designer, illustrator, and 3D modeler.With a splash of cuteness, I create games that get you pondering about your relationships and your place in the world. Oh, and sometimes I write music too! ðŸŽ¶ Whether it's a pixel-perfect illustration or a game that touches your soul, my goal is simple: to make you think, feel, and maybe even smile. So come on in, let's get to know each other!
