Hello, we are Teacup Whale!

We're a small game design studio located in Portland, Oregon!
We're working on a small life sim that we hope brings something new to relationship mechanics.

We also pick up occasional projects to help other folks out, too!

If you wanna stay up to date on the latest we're working on,and help us playtest along the way, sign up for our newsletter below!
